These are the R scripts that I wrote to import, clean, organize, and visualize eyetracking data from TobiiProUnitySDK in the Virtual Storytelling experiment programs. This documentation should be updated in the future, but below is a brief information about the scripts:<br><br>
importvisualizegaze.R --> direct data import & visualization<br>
missinggazeretrieval.R --> missing data retrieval + data import & visualization<br><br>
All scripts include data cleaning and organization.
